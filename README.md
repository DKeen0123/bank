## Getting Started

### Installing

You will need to clone this repo and install dependencies (You will need [bundler](http://bundler.io/) for this step.).
In your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/DKeen0123/bank
bundle install
```

## Running the tests

The application is unit tested with RSpec. To run the tests, go to the root of the project repo in your terminal and run the command:

```
 rspec
```
